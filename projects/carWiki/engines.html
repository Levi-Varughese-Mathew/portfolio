			<h2>What are engines?</h2>
		 		Engines are mechanical devices designed to convert various forms of energy into 
				mechanical energy, often used to perform work or generate power. They are crucial components in many 
				vehicles, machines, and power systems. Different types of engines exist, each operating on specific 
				principles and fuel sources.

			<h2>Types of engines</h2>
			Internal Combustion Engines:<br>
				- Petrol/Gasoline Engines: Used in most cars, these engines burn a mixture of petrol and air.<br>
				- Diesel Engines: Commonly found in trucks and some cars, diesel engines combust diesel fuel and air<br>
				- Natural Gas Engines: Used in certain vehicles and industrial applications, these engines run on natural gas.<br>			
			Electric Motors: Founds in electric vehicles (EV's)<br>
			Hybrid Engines: Seen in vehicles, where an internal combustion engine is combined with electric propulsion<br>

			<h2>Cylinders</h2>
			  In an internal combustion engine, cylinders are the individual cylindrical chambers within the engine block
			  where the combustion process takes place. Each cylinder houses a piston that moves up and down within the cylinder 
			  to compress air and fuel, initiate combustion, and produce mechanical power<br>

			  <img class="info" src = "images/engines/cylinder.jpg" alt="Cylinders of an Engine" title="Cylinders of an Engine">
			  <img class="info" src = "images/engines/piston.jpg" alt="A Piston" title="A Piston">

			<h2>Capacity:</h2>
			  The total volume of all the cylinders in an engine determines its capacity or displacement, 
			  often measured in liters or cubic inches. Engine capacity is a factor influencing an engine's power and performance.

			<h2>Pistons:</h2> 
			  Pistons are cylindrical components that fit into each cylinder. They move up and down within the cylinder, 
			  creating the necessary conditions for combustion and converting the pressure generated into mechanical motion

			<h2>Engine Configuration:</h2> 
			  The number of cylinders in an engine contributes to its overall design. Common configurations include four-cylinder, 
			  six-cylinder, eight-cylinder, and even higher configurations in performance or larger vehicles

			Number of cylinders in cars with images V6, V8, V12, W16

			<h2>Intake:</h2>
			What is an Intake?: In a car, the term "intake" typically refers to the air intake system, which is a crucial 
			component for the internal combustion engine. The air intake system is responsible for bringing air into the engine, 
			where it mixes with fuel for combustion. A well-designed intake system ensures the engine receives a consistent and optimal 
			supply of air to maximize performance and efficiency.<br><br>

			<h2>Types of Intakes:</h2>
			Stock Air Intake: The factory-installed intake system designed to meet general performance requirements and emissions standards.<br><br>
			
			Cold Air Intake (CAI): Draws cooler air from outside the engine bay to provide denser air for combustion, potentially improving
			performance and efficiency.<br><br>
			<img class="info" src = "images/engines/cai.jpg" alt="Image of a Cold Air Intake" title="Cold Air Intake"><br>
			
			Ram Air Intake: Utilizes the forward motion of the vehicle to force air into the intake system, particularly effective at higher speeds.<br><br>
			
			Short Ram Intake (SRI): Shorter and more direct intake path designed for improved airflow and quicker throttle response.<br><br>
			<img class="info" src = "images/engines/shortRamIntake.jpg" alt="Image of a Short Ram Intake" title="Short Ram Intake"><br><br>

			Dual-Stage Intake: Features two modes for different driving conditions, optimizing performance at both low and high RPMs.<br><br>
			<img class="info" src = "images/engines/dualStageIntake(1).jpg" alt="Diagram showing Dual Stage Intake" title="Dual Stage Intake">
			<img class="info" src = "images/engines/dualStageIntake(2).jpg" alt="Diagram showing Dual Stage Intake" title="Dual Stage Intake"><br>

			High-Flow Air Intake: Maximizes the volume of air entering the engine, often with larger-diameter intake tubes and high-flow air filters<br><br>
			
			OEM+ Intake: Aftermarket intake retaining a close resemblance to the stock system while offering improvements in airflow and performance.<br><br>
			
			Custom Fabricated Intake: Custom-designed intake systems tailored to specific needs, involving modifications or entirely new systems.<br><br>
			
			Turbocharger: Compresses intake air using exhaust gases, increasing air density and supplying more oxygen to the engine for combustion. 
			(add turbo whistle)<br>
			<img class="info" src = "images/engines/turbocharger.jpg" alt="Image of a Turbocharger" title="Turbocharger">
			<br><br>
			
			Supercharger: Mechanically compresses intake air using a belt connected to the engine's crankshaft, providing immediate power delivery 
			and increased air density. (add turbo whistle)<br><br>
			<img class="info" src = "images/engines/supercharger.jpg" alt="Image of a Supercharger" title="Supercharger">
			<img class="info" src = "images/engines/supercharger1.jpg" alt="Image of a Supercharger" title="Supercharger">

			<h2>Horsepower:</h2> Horsepower (hp) is a unit of measurement used to quantify the power output of an engine. It is a common unit for 
			expressing the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred.
			<img class="info" src = "images/engines/horsepower.jpg" alt="Diagram Calculating Horsepower" title="Calculate Horsepower">

			<h2>Torque:</h2>
			Torque in a car refers to the rotational force generated by the engine that enables the vehicle's wheels to turn. 
			It is a crucial parameter for understanding the engine's ability to perform work, and it plays a significant role in determining a 
			vehicle's acceleration, towing capacity, and overall performance.<br><br>

			<img class="info" src = "images/engines/torqueVsHp.jpg" alt="Difference between Horsepower and Torque" title="Horsepower VS Torque">

			<h2>Differential:</h2> 
			Differential is a component in a car's drivetrain that allows the wheels to rotate at different speeds while 
			maintaining equal torque. It is an essential part of most vehicles, especially those with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive systems. 
			The primary purpose of a differential is to address the difference in rotational speed between the inner and outer wheels when the vehicle 
			is turning.<br>
			Vehicles with 4WD or AWD often have front and rear differentials to distribute power between the front and rear axles, allowing all 
			four wheels to receive torque.	

			<h2>Types of Differentials:</h2>
			1.Open Differential: Allows wheels to rotate at different speeds during turns. It is the most common type and is effective for regular 
			driving conditions.<br>
			2.Limited Slip Differential (LSD): Provides some degree of wheel speed differentiation, improving traction in certain conditions. 
			LSDs can be mechanical, viscous, or electronic.<br>
			3.Locking Differential: Can be manually or automatically engaged to lock both wheels together, ensuring equal torque distribution. 
			It is useful for off-road or low-traction situations.<br><br>

			<h2>Crankshaft:</h2>
			Converts the reciprocating motion of the engine's pistons into rotational motion, providing power to the vehicle's drivetrain.
			<img class="info" src = "images/engines/crankshaft.jpg" alt="Image of a Crankshaft" title="Crankshaft">

			<h2>Camshaft:</h2>
			Controls the opening and closing of the engine's valves, coordinating with the crankshaft to regulate the intake and exhaust processes 
			during combustion<br>
			<img class="info" src = "images/engines/camshaft.jpg" alt="Image of a Camshaft" title="Camshaft"><br><br>
